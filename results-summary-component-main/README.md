### What I learned

I learned about Flexbox and its properties, such as the flex container and flex items, flex direction, justify content, and align items for centering our elements. Additionally, I gained knowledge in flex basis, growth, and shrink properties. I also acquired the skill of applying Flexbox to create responsive and adaptive layouts that automatically adjust to various screen sizes and devices. Google Chrome proved to be a valuable tool for previewing my projects on different devices.
